      <h2>Our History</h2>
      When we started Learn2Code, our goal was to give anyone in the world the
      ability to learn the skills they’d need to succeed in the 21st century. We
      set out to create a new, interactive way of learning — making it engaging,
      flexible, and accessible for as many people as possible. Since then, we
      have helped millions of people worldwide unlock modern technical skills
      and reach their full potential through code.
      <br><br>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      We want to create a world where anyone can build something meaningful with
      technology, and everyone has the learning tools, resources, and
      opportunities to do so. Code contains a world of possibilities — all
      that’s required is the curiosity and drive to learn. At Learn2Code, we are
      committed to empowering all people, regardless of where they are in their
      coding journeys, to continue to learn, grow, and make an impact on the
      world around them.

      <div class="special-text">
      Learn2Code increases diversity in computer science by reaching students of
      all backgrounds where they are — at their skill-level, in their schools,
      and in ways that inspire them to keep learning. The vast majority of the
      students on Learn2Code are from student groups historically
      underrepresented in computer science. Increasing diversity in computer
      science is foundational to our work, and we encourage you to read more
      about our efforts.
