      <h2>What is C++?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create
          high-performance applications.
        </li>

        <li>
          ++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C
          language.
        </li>

        <li>
          C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources
          and memory.
        </li>

        <li>
          language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to
          C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Why Use C++</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.</li>

        <li>
          C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User
          Interfaces, and embedded systems.
        </li>

        <li>
          C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear
          structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering
          development costs.
        </li>

        <li>
          C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be
          adapted to multiple platforms.
        </li>

        <li>C++ is fun and easy to learn!</li>

        <li>
          As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to
          switch to C++ or vice versa.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>C++ Install IDE</h2>
      An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND compile
      the code. Popular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio.
      These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C++ code.
      Note: Web-based IDE's can work as well, but functionality is limited. We
      will use Code::Blocks in our tutorial, which we believe is a good place to
      start. You can find the latest version of Codeblocks at
      http://www.codeblocks.org/. Download the mingw-setup.exe file, which will
      install the text editor with a compiler.
