        Java is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It is one of
        the most popular programming languages u sed to develop desktop and
        mobile applications, big data processing, embedded systems and so on.

      <h1>Features of Java Programming</h1>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Java is platform-independent</h2>
      <p>
        Java was built with the philosophy of "write once, run anywhere" (WORA).
        The Java code you write on one platform (operating system) will run on
        other platforms with no modification.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>An object-oriented Language</h2>
      <p>
        The object-oriented approach is one of the popular programming styles.
        In object-oriented programming, a complex problem is divided into
        smaller sets by creating objects. This makes Java code reusable, has
        design benefits and makes code easier to maintain.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Java is fast</h2>
      <p>
        The earlier version of Java was criticized for being slow. However, the
        new version of Java is one of the fastest programming languages. ooA
        well-optimized Java code is nearly as fast as lower-level languages like
        C/C++ and much faster than Python, PHP, etc.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Java is secure</h2>
      <p>
        Some of the high-level features for security that Java handles are:
        <br />
        1.provides a secure platform for developing and running applications<br />
        2.automatic memory management reduces memory corruption and
        vulnerabilities
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Large Standard Library</h2>
      <p>
        One of the reasons why Java is widely used is because of the
        availability of a huge standard library. The Java environment has
        hundreds of classes and methods under different packages to help
        software developers like us.
