      <h1>Python for beginners</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome! Are you completely new to programming? If not then we presume
        you will be looking for information about why and how to get started
        with Python. Fortunately an experienced programmer in any programming
        language (whatever it may be) can pick up Python very quickly. It's also
        easy for beginners to use and learn, so jump in!
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h1>Installing</h1>
      <p>
        Installing Python is generally easy, and nowadays many Linux and UNIX
        distributions include a recent Python. Even some Windows computers
        (notably those from HP) now come with Python already installed. If you
        do need to install Python and aren't confident about the task you can
        find a few notes on the BeginnersGuide/Download wiki page, but
        installation is unremarkable on most platforms.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h1>Learning</h1>
      <p>
        Before getting started, you may want to find out which IDEs and text
        editors are tailored to make Python editing easy, browse the list of
        introductory books, or look at code samples that you might find helpful.
        <br />
        There is a list of tutorials suitable for experienced programmers on the
        BeginnersGuide/Tutorials page. There is also a list of resources in
        other languages which might be useful if English is not your first
        language.
        <br />
        The online documentation is your first port of call for definitive
        information. There is a fairly brief tutorial that gives you basic
        information about the language and gets you started. You can follow this
        by looking at the library reference for a full description of Python's
        many libraries and the language reference for a complete (though
        somewhat dry) explanation of Python's syntax. If you are looking for
        common Python recipes and patterns, you can browse the ActiveState
        Python Cookbook
